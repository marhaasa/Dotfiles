# Dotfiles #WIP
A collection of all my public config and dotfiles.

Things are sort of up and running now, but there are a few things that need to be fixed.

 - [ ] Alacritty directory structure
 - [ ] brew install x y z
 - [ ] more flexibility when it comes to having different usernames on different machines in setup.sh


# Notes from installing on second mbp 2024-07-18

Everything went quite smoothly except the following things:
- Some structure tweaks for alacritty.toml and alacritty/themes
- Ran `chsh -s /bin/bash` to set bash as default shell (NB! not homebrew bash)
- Needed to install Ubuntu Mono Nerdfonts semi manually through download and install
- some treesitter errors in nvim setup
